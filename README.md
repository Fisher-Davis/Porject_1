# **Ukraine News Now**

## **Project Description**

On February 24, 2022, the Kremlin escalated the Russo-Ukranian War, which began in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea, by invading Ukraine. This unwarranted act of aggression has levelled cities and displaced a quarter of Ukraine's population. 

The goal of our project is to consolidate daily and weekly news articles on the ongoing Ukraine crisis to keep people informed and combat disinformation.

### User Story

```
AS A citizen who is concerned about world events
I WANT to see news and opportunities to get involved
SO THAT I can make a positive impact and help Ukrainian refugees. 
```

### Future Development

In the future, we hope to include the following features in Ukraine News Now:
- Implementing the **[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)** to provide a live feed for all tweets tagged #Ukraine
- A location feature that enables to **[Charity Navigator API](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1397)** to show charities and volunteer opportunities within a user's locale
- Expanding the **[News API](https://newsapi.org)** to allow users to select specific news sources and specify date ranges
